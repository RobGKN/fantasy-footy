# AFL Fantasy Breakout Predictor

## Overview
This project aims to explore the use of machine learning to predict "breakout" AFL Fantasy players based on historical performance and pricing data. The goal is to experiment with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and PyTorch-based modeling.

## Planned Steps
1. Preprocess historical AFL Fantasy data.
2. Build and train a machine learning model.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.
4. Use the model to make predictions on new data.

## Structure
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `saved_models/`: Directory for storing trained models.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the project.

This is a work in progress.
