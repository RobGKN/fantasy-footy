# AFL Fantasy ML Dataset Specification

This document outlines the structure, sources, and data types of all features available in the AFL Fantasy dataset, prepared for machine learning applications. The dataset spans player performance and pricing data from 2017 to 2025 and supports building models to predict fantasy outcomes or inform player recommendations.

## Primary Unit of Analysis
Each row represents a single player in a single season. The goal is typically to predict a player's performance in year Y, using information from year Y-1 and earlier.
